Analysing Molecular Dynamics Trajectories

I work with a lot of classical molecular dynamics simulations in my PhD work. My focus is generally simulating ionic liquids. 
I like to play around with different codes but I like a LAMMPS a lot, it's a flexible, well documented fast code written in C++ that can run efficiently on a desktop or over mutiple nodes on a large cluster. 
I also run simulations with DL_POLY, a much slower code written in FORTRAN. Not ideal, but with FORTRAN generally being legacy code, it's become a necessary evil to learn.
